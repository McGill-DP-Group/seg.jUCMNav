Commands related to Concerns

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package contains commands related to concerns. Currently, the commands are only called from the 
seg.jUCMNav.views.wizards.concerns.ConcernsManager wizard. Some of the commands are internal commands 
(they have the prefix "Internal"). Such commands are not called directly by the ConcernsManager but 
only by other commands in this package.
</p>
<p>
This package is tightly linked to seg.jUCMNav.model.commands.JUCMNavCommand and possibly to other 
commands in the seg.jUCMNav.model.commands package or one of its subpackages.
