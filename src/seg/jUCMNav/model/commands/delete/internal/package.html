Internal commands that remove elements from the URNspec

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
These commands remove elements from the URNspec. Some are fairly straightforward, but others more complicated. See DevDocDeletion for more information. This package contains classes used by the public interface to delete the elements; they should not be called by external modules, simply by the seg.jUCMNav.model.commands.delete package.
