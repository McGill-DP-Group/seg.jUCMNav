GEF Commands

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package contains (via subpackages) all our our GEF commands. Commands are the GEF way to modify the model instance used by our application. See DevDocCommands for more information / testing issues. 
</p>
<p>
Regular Commands (not necessarily CompoundCommands) should implement the JUCMNavCommand interface and test their commands at the lower level, during execution.
