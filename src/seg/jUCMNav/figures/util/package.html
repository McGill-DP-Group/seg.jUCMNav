Utility classes used by figures. 

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
The locators are simply stolen from the framework with a few slight modifications to ensure they don't crash or to add refreshing code. If we can refactor our code remove our dependency on these classes (and move them to the original framework classes), our application would be improved. 
</p>
<p>
JUCMNavFigure is used by labels to know how large the figure is in order to position new labels properly.
