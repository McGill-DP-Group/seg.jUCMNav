ConnectionAnchors used by the figures and possibly by the UCMConnectionRouter. 

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
EditParts define source and target connection anchors. GEF uses these to have handles to which connections may be tied. We've circumvented this mechanisms for our spline drawing but our AndFork/AndJoin figures use connection anchors for all of the outgoing/incoming branches.
