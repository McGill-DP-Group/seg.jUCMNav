The seg.jUCMNav.extensionpoints folder contains different interfaces,
each of one being the interface that must be implemented when creating
extensions to jUCMNav.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Currently, only two types of extension points exist in jUCMNav:
import and export. You can import or export a URN file (containing
possibly multiple maps) via the IURNImport and IURNExport interfaces.
Furthermore, the IUseCaseMapExport extension point has been created to
allow the user to export files that are solely related to one particular
map. For example, when exporting the visual representation (screenshot)
of a UCM, use the IUseCaseMapExport.</p>
