EditParts used by UrnOutlinePage

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
EditParts are GEF specific; we recommend you read some GEF documentation before playing with these classes. See DevDocEditPartCreation to understand how EditParts are created and DevDocOutline to see how the outline works. UrnOutlinePage is a TreeView; our elements are therefore TreeEditParts. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>The edit part factory is TreeEditPartFactory.</li>
<li>Our root edit part is OutlineRootEditPart</li>
<li>All model elements use UcmModelElementTreeEditPart</li>
</ul>

<p>
Newcomers should look into UcmModelElementTreeEditPart and PathNodeTreeEditPart to have an understanding of what a tree edit part has to do.  Other classes might be too implementation specific to allow for good understanding.
